========================

Enables a simple "Launch" system for [codebox](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox).

TODO:
------------------------

- [ ] Find a better way to pass multiple commands (node side)
- [ ] Since rpc doesn't depends on Q, refactor the service (node side)
- [ ] Let user save some configurations to its settings (not workspace bounded)
- [ ] Save active configuration in user settings to retrieve it at startup
- [ ] Better collaboration support on configurations
- [ ] UI adjustments
